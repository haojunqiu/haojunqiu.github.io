Hi! I am an undergraduate student in the University of Toronto, specializing computer science. My research interest broadly span computer vision, computational imaging, computer graphics, and machine learning. 

I am advised by [Prof. David B. Lindell](https://davidlindell.com) and [Prof. Kyros Kutulakos](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kyros/), working on the topic of score-based generative modeling and internal learning (modeling the patch distribution of a single image instance).

I spent a wonderful summer at Stanford, working with [Prof. Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com), [Dr. Shangzhe Wu](https://elliottwu.com), [Chen Geng](https://chen-geng.com), and [Yunzhi Zhang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~yzzhang/).

I would be excited to chat anything: [harry.qiu@mail.utoronto.ca](mailto:harry.qiu@mail.utoronto.ca)

<!-- Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
