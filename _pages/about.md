Hi! I am a researcher on the Sensor Simulation team at [Waabi](https://www.waabi.ai), working on world modeling and simulation for autonomous driving. I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Toronto, where I worked with [Prof. David B. Lindell](https://davidlindell.com) and [Prof. Kyros Kutulakos](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kyros/) on score-based generative modeling and patch-based methods, focusing on training-free and efficient single-image generative modeling via closed-form diffusion models.

In Summer 2024, I conducted research at Stanford University with [Prof. Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com), [Prof. Shangzhe Wu](https://elliottwu.com), 
focusing on video score distillation and motion modeling. In Summer 2025, I participated in the [Summer Geometry Initiative (SGI)]((https://sgi.mit.edu)) at MIT, where I explored some topics in geometry processing (Monte Carlo geometry processing, logarithmic heat diffusion, and fluid simulation with gaussian velocity field).

My current research interests broadly span generative models (diffusion/flow models), and 3D/4D scene representations, especially when it comes to connecting theory and efficient algorithms.

<!-- Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
